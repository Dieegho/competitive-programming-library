/// \brief Solves the maximum flow problem using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
///
/// The member type \c edge of \c Graph must contain the following fields:
/// \li \c capacity: The maximum flow allowed through the edge.
/// \li \c flow: Output field where the final flow of each edge will be put on.
/// This field should be mutable.
/// \li \c rev_edge: A pointer to the reverse edge. Note that a reverse edge
/// must exist even though it was not intended to be part of the modeled graph.
/// In such a case, the reverse edge should have a capacity of 0. In case of
/// existence of parallel edges, each edge <tt>(u, v)</tt> must have its own
/// counterpart <tt>(v, u)</tt>.
///
/// \tparam Graph The directed graph type. Must model a flow network.
///
/// \param graph The target graph.
/// \param source The source vertex.
/// \param target The target vertex.
///
/// \returns The maximum possible flow from \p source to \p target. The final
/// flow of each edge in the graph will be recorded in their flow field.
///
/// \pre <tt>source != target</tt>
///
/// \par Complexity
/// At most O(V * E^2) memory accesses, where <tt>V = graph.num_vertices()</tt>
/// and <tt>E = graph.num_edges()</tt>.
